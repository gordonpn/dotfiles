# Install and configure automatic delegation

The dotfiles repository is the source of truth for this skill and the
Antigravity auto-delegation rule. Run `bin/mcp-sync` from the repository root
to link them into `~/.agents/skills/` and
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/rules/`, then mirror the shared skill into Codex,
OpenCode, and Antigravity's skill discovery directory. Existing conflicting
local copies are backed up by the sync script.

Automatic delegation requires explicit opt-in in each eligible repository:

```bash
git config --local agents.delegationAllowed true
```

Restart active Codex and agy sessions to load the updated skill and rule.
Configure narrow build/test command permissions separately; never blindly
enable global shell-approval bypass.

## Notes

- Parent Codex delegates to OpenCode or agy; parent agy delegates only to OpenCode.
- Automatic repo opt-in avoids accidentally sending confidential employer sources to an external hosted model.
- If no repo opt-in exists, the agent should complete tasks itself or explain that delegation is blocked.
- Both delegations operate on a clean committed checkout; current uncommitted edits cannot be safely inherited.
- To run a delegate manually without the opt-in gate, omit `--automatic`, but still ensure the repository is appropriate for external inference.
- Plans stay in an isolated detached worktree, builds on new `delegate/...` branches; review and integrate only verified changes.
